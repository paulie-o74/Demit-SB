# About
This is a full-stack e-commerce project built using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have created this website for 'Demit', a real artist, however with dummy images and products. It is a business that sells prints, one of one paintings on canvas as well as a contact point for commissioned pieces, murals and brand collaboration.
